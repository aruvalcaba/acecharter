We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13, except for that child’s name, email address, and child’s parent’s email address, without parental consent being obtained from his or her parent or guardian, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
